# code-of-ethics

A collection of ethical code for those creating tech content. 

1. **Make financial relationships clear** — If affiliate links are used, go above and beyond government guidelines, make it as clear as possible any financial incentives or motivations you have before referencing books, courses where there is a financial relationship. 

2. **Prefer data-led information** — Seek to answer questions with data. Some data is better than no data. Whenever you share your own opinion, seek to make it clear what is based on your experience, vs data. Share data sources. 

3. **Be conscious of representation** — When running events, consider inviting a range of folks from different backgrounds. Where possible, share opportunities to those who are new to the industry. 

4. **Provide free options** — Where possible, grant an option to receive a product or service without paying, e.g. if someone is unemployed. 

5. **Provide weighted pricing based on region** - If possible, provide discounts to those in countries with weaker currencies, price based on local economies, not based solely on western economies.
